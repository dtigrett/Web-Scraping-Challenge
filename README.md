# Web-Scraping-Challenge

In this assignment,  a web application was built that scraped various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars project and displayed
the information in a single HTML page.  Initial scraping was done using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.
Using MongoDB with Flask templating a new HTML page was created that displayed all of the information that was scraped from various URL's.
